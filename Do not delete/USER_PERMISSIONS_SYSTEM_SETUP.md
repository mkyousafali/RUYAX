## Overview

The Ruyax system implements a comprehensive, role-based access control (RBAC) system with function-level permissions. This system allows fine-grained control over what users can do across the application through a combination of:

- **Function-based permissions**: 80+ defined system functions with granular control
- **Role-based permissions**: Role-to-function mappings stored in database
- **User permissions**: Individual user permission overrides
- **Interface permissions**: Control over desktop/mobile/customer/cashier interface access
- **Approval permissions**: Workflow-specific approval capabilities with amount limits

---

## System Architecture

### Permission Hierarchy

```
User Account (users table)
â”œâ”€â”€ user_type (global/branch_specific/customer)
â”œâ”€â”€ role_type (Master Admin/Admin/Position-based/Customer)
â”œâ”€â”€ position_id â†’ Position details
â”œâ”€â”€ interface_permissions (desktop/mobile/customer/cashier access)
â”œâ”€â”€ approval_permissions (approval workflows)
â””â”€â”€ permissions (JSON field: explicit per-function permissions)
    â””â”€â”€ Falls back to user_roles â†’ role_permissions (role-based defaults)
```

### Permission Resolution Flow

1. Check user's explicit `permissions` field (users.permissions JSONB)
2. If not found, fall back to user's `role_type`
3. If Master Admin â†’ All permissions granted
4. If Admin â†’ Most permissions granted (except delete in some cases)
5. If Position-based â†’ Check role_permissions table for specific function

---

## Permission Types & Actions

### Permission Actions (5-Action Matrix)

Each function has up to 5 distinct permission types:

| Action | Code | Database Column | Meaning |
|--------|------|-----------------|---------|
| View | `can_view` | `can_view` | Can see/access the feature |
| Create/Add | `can_add` | `can_add` | Can create new records |
| Edit/Update | `can_edit` | `can_edit` | Can modify existing records |
| Delete | `can_delete` | `can_delete` | Can delete records |
| Export | `can_export` | `can_export` | Can export data |

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
hasPermission('USER_MANAGEMENT', 'can_view')      // Can see user list?
hasPermission('USER_MANAGEMENT', 'can_add')       // Can create new user?
hasPermission('USER_MANAGEMENT', 'can_edit')      // Can edit user details?
hasPermission('USER_MANAGEMENT', 'can_delete')    // Can delete user?
hasPermission('USER_MANAGEMENT', 'can_export')    // Can export users?
```

## Role Types & User Types

### Role Types (4 Levels)

| Role Type | Code | Permissions | Usage |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| Master Admin | `Master Admin` | All functions, all actions | System administrator |
| Admin | `Admin` | Most functions, restricted delete | Branch/functional administrator |
| Position-based | `Position-based` | Based on assigned position & role_permissions | Regular employees |
| Customer | `Customer` | Customer app specific functions | End customers |

### User Types (3 Categories)

| User Type | Code | Scope | Details |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| Global | `global` | System-wide access | Access to all branches |
| Branch-specific | `branch_specific` | Single or multiple branches | Limited to assigned branches only |
| Customer | `customer` | Customer application only | Cannot access admin/staff features |

   â†’ Grant all permissions
ELSE IF role_type === 'Admin'
   â†’ Grant all permissions except delete (in most cases)
ELSE IF role_type === 'Position-based'
   â†’ Look up position_id â†’ hr_positions
   â†’ Find role_permissions for that position
   â†’ Use those permissions
ELSE
   â†’ No permission (default deny)
```

**Relationships:**
- `employee_id` references `hr_employees.id`
- `branch_id` references `branches.id`
- `position_id` references `hr_positions.id`
- `created_by` and `updated_by` reference `users.id` (self-referential)

**Approval Logic:**
```
When user attempts to approve:
1. Check can_approve_[type] = true
2. Check request_amount <= [type]_amount_limit
3. Grant or deny based on both conditions

Example: Approve $5000 requisition
- can_approve_requisitions: true
- requisition_amount_limit: 10000
â†’ APPROVED (amount under limit)

Example: Approve $15000 requisition
- can_approve_requisitions: true
- requisition_amount_limit: 10000
â†’ DENIED (amount exceeds limit, needs higher authority)
```

**Constraints:**
- Unique key: `(user_id)` - one approval permission set per user
- Foreign key: `user_id` references `users.id` on delete cascade

**Typical Setup:**
```
Level 1 Approver:
- can_approve_requisitions: true, limit: $500
- can_approve_single_bill: true, limit: $1000
- can_approve_vendor_payments: true, limit: $500

Level 2 Approver:
- can_approve_requisitions: true, limit: $5000
- can_approve_single_bill: true, limit: $10000
- can_approve_vendor_payments: true, limit: $5000

- can_approve_requisitions: true, limit: $50000
- can_approve_single_bill: true, limit: $100000
- can_approve_vendor_payments: true, limit: $50000
```

## Data Flow & Implementation

### 1. User Login Flow

```
User enters credentials
â†“
POST /api/auth/login
â†“
Backend validates credentials
â†“
If valid:
  - Query users table
  - Query users.permissions (JSONB)
  - Query user_roles table (if position-based)
  - Query interface_permissions
  - Query approval_permissions
â†“
Return AuthSession with:
  - token (JWT)
  - user object (with all permissions populated)
  - loginMethod
  - loginTime
  - expiresAt
â†“
Frontend:
  - Store user object in Svelte store (user.js or persistentAuth.ts)
  - Load interface_permissions to determine accessible UIs
  - Initialize permission checking system
  - Store token in localStorage/sessionStorage
```

---

### 2. Permission Check Flow During User Interaction

```
User clicks button (e.g., "Delete User")
â†“
Frontend checks:
  hasPermission('USER_MANAGEMENT', 'can_delete')
â†“
hasPermission function executes:
  1. Get current user from store
  2. Check user.permissions['USER_MANAGEMENT']?.can_delete
     - If found â†’ use that value
     - If not found â†’ continue to step 3
  3. Check user.roleType
     - If 'Master Admin' â†’ return true
     - If 'Admin' â†’ return true (for delete: false)
     - Else â†’ return false
â†“
If hasPermission returns true:
  - Enable button / Show action
  - User can proceed
â†“
If hasPermission returns false:
  - Disable button / Hide action
  - Show permission denied message
â†“
On submit (if allowed):
  POST /api/users/[id]  (with delete flag)
â†“
Backend verifies:
  - Re-check permission server-side
  - If unauthorized â†’ 403 Forbidden
  - If authorized â†’ Process deletion
  - Log action in user_audit_logs
```

---

### 3. Role Assignment Flow

```
Admin creates new role:
  - POST /api/roles
  - Create user_roles record

Admin defines permissions for role:
  - For each of 80+ functions:
    POST /api/role-permissions
    - role_id: UUID of new role
    - function_id: UUID of function
    - can_view: boolean
    - can_add: boolean
    - can_edit: boolean
    - can_delete: boolean
    - can_export: boolean
â†“
Admin assigns role to user:
  - PUT /api/users/[user_id]
  - Update: role_type = 'Position-based'
  - Update: position_id = role's position
â†“
When user logs in next:
  - User's permissions loaded from role_permissions table
  - Via: user.position_id â†’ role_permissions.role_id
```

---

### 4. User-Specific Permission Override Flow

```
Master Admin assigns custom permission to user:
  - Current user permissions loaded from users.permissions (JSONB)
  - Toggle specific action for specific function
  - PUT /api/users/[user_id]/permissions
  - Update users.permissions JSONB field
â†“
When user next checks permission:
  - hasPermission() finds value in users.permissions
  - Uses that value (overrides role defaults)
  - Specific permission takes precedence
```

---

### 5. Approval Workflow Permission Check

```
User attempts to approve $8000 requisition
â†“
System checks:
  1. Query approval_permissions for user_id
  2. Check can_approve_requisitions = true?
  3. Check requisition_amount_limit >= 8000?
â†“
If both true:
  - Allow approval
  - Update requisition status
  - Log approval action
â†“
If either false:
  - Deny approval
  - Show: "Amount exceeds your approval limit"
  - Show: "Please route to higher authority"
  - Suggest approvers with higher limits
```

---

### 6. Interface Access Control

```
User logs in
â†“
Load interface_permissions for user_id
â†“
Desktop enabled? â†’ Show desktop interface
Mobile enabled? â†’ Show mobile interface
Customer enabled? â†’ Show customer portal
Cashier enabled? â†’ Show cashier interface
â†“
If not enabled:
  - Hide from navigation
  - Block direct URL access
  - Show: "You don't have access to this interface"
```

## System Setup Checklist

### Initial Setup

- [ ] **Create app_functions records** (80+ function codes)
  - Command: `scripts/seed-functions.sql`
  - Records: One per function code
  - Fields: function_name, function_code, description, category

- [ ] **Create system user_roles** (MASTER_ADMIN, ADMIN)
  - Master Administrator role
  - Administrator role
  - Mark as `is_system_role = true`

- [ ] **Populate role_permissions**
  - Master Admin: All functions Ã— all permissions = true
  - Admin: All functions Ã— (view/add/edit/export = true, delete = false)
  - Expected records: 86+ per role

- [ ] **Create initial admin user**
  - username: admin
  - role_type: Master Admin
  - Set strong password
  - Test login and permission verification

### Per-User Setup

- [ ] **Create user_roles for custom positions** (Cashier, Picker, etc.)
- [ ] **Define role_permissions for each custom role**
- [ ] **Create user in users table**
- [ ] **Create interface_permissions record** (set accessible UIs)
- [ ] **Create approval_permissions record** (if needed)
- [ ] **Test all permission scenarios**

### Testing Scenarios

```
1. Master Admin
   âœ“ Can view all functions
   âœ“ Can create/edit/delete/export
   âœ“ Access all interfaces

2. Admin
   âœ“ Can view all functions
   âœ“ Can create/edit/export
   âœ— Cannot delete
   âœ“ Access admin interfaces

3. Cashier (Position-based)
   âœ“ Can view sales functions
   âœ“ Can create orders
   âœ— Cannot delete orders
   âœ— Cannot view finance
   âœ“ Access cashier interface only

4. Custom Override
   âœ“ Position-based role limits apply
   âœ“ Master Admin specific permission override works
   âœ“ User permission takes precedence over role

5. Interface Permissions
   âœ“ Disabled interfaces not accessible
   âœ“ Enabled interfaces fully accessible
   âœ“ Mobile users can't access desktop-only features
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always use FUNCTION_CODES constant** - Never hardcode function codes
2. **Check permissions before rendering UI** - Use canView(), canCreate(), etc.
3. **Check permissions before API calls** - Use hasPermission() before sending requests
4. **Implement server-side checks** - Never trust client-side permission checks alone
5. **Log all permission-dependent actions** - Record in user_audit_logs
6. **Use specific permission checks** - Don't just check role types

### For Administrators

1. **Create role-based permissions, not user-specific** - Easier to manage at scale
2. **Use role hierarchy** - Master Admin > Admin > Position-based > Customer
3. **Set reasonable approval limits** - Based on position and responsibility
4. **Review permissions quarterly** - Ensure still appropriate for role
5. **Enable only needed interfaces** - Reduce confusion and security risk
6. **Document role definitions** - Store in user_roles.description field

### For Security

1. **Always verify server-side** - Client-side checks are for UX only
2. **Implement rate limiting** - On permission check endpoints
3. **Audit all permission changes** - Log in user_audit_logs with reason
4. **Lock accounts after failed attempts** - Use failed_login_attempts field
5. **Implement token expiration** - users.password_expires_at and session tokens
6. **Regular permission audits** - Check for orphaned permissions
7. **Segregation of duties** - Critical functions require multiple approvers

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Conditional UI Rendering

```svelte
<script>
  import { canView, canCreate, canDelete } from '$lib/utils/permissions';
</script>

{#if canView('USER_MANAGEMENT')}
  <div class="user-list">
    <!-- User list component -->
  </div>
{/if}

{#if canCreate('USER_MANAGEMENT')}
  <button>Create User</button>
{/if}

{#if canDelete('USER_MANAGEMENT')}
  <button>Delete User</button>
{/if}
```

### Pattern 2: Permission-Aware API Integration

```typescript
import { hasPermission } from '$lib/utils/permissions';

async function deleteUser(userId) {
  if (!hasPermission('USER_MANAGEMENT', 'can_delete')) {
    throw new Error('Permission denied: Cannot delete users');
  }
  
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`, {
    method: 'DELETE'
  });
  
  if (response.status === 403) {
    // Server also denied - permission revoked since check
    throw new Error('Permission denied by server');
  }
  
  return response.json();
}
```

### Pattern 3: Role-Based Navigation

```typescript
import { isMasterAdmin, isAdmin, getUserRole } from '$lib/utils/permissions';

function getAvailableMenuItems() {
  const items = [];
  
  // Basic items (everyone)
  items.push({ label: 'Dashboard', path: '/dashboard' });
  items.push({ label: 'My Profile', path: '/profile' });
  
  // Staff items
  if (getUserRole() !== 'Customer') {
    items.push({ label: 'Orders', path: '/orders' });
    items.push({ label: 'Products', path: '/products' });
  }
  
  // Admin items
  if (isAdmin() || isMasterAdmin()) {
    items.push({ label: 'Users', path: '/admin/users' });
    items.push({ label: 'Reports', path: '/admin/reports' });
  }
  
  // Master Admin items
  if (isMasterAdmin()) {
    items.push({ label: 'System Settings', path: '/admin/settings' });
  }
  
  return items;
}
```

### Pattern 4: Approval Workflow

```typescript
import { db } from '$lib/utils/supabase';

async function approveRequisition(requisitionId, approvalAmount) {
  // Check user's approval permissions
  const approver = get(currentUser);
  
  const { data: approvalPerms } = await db
    .from('approval_permissions')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', approver.id)
    .single();
  
  // Check if user can approve requisitions
  if (!approvalPerms?.can_approve_requisitions) {
    throw new Error('You do not have requisition approval permissions');
  }
  
  // Check if amount is within limit
  if (approvalAmount > approvalPerms.requisition_amount_limit) {
    throw new Error(
      `Amount ${approvalAmount} exceeds your limit of ${approvalPerms.requisition_amount_limit}`
    );
  }
  
  // Approve
  await db
    .from('requisitions')
    .update({ status: 'approved', approved_by: approver.id })
    .eq('id', requisitionId);
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User can't see feature but should be able to

**Check:**
1. Is user.permissions field populated with that function?
2. Does user have the correct role_type?
3. If position-based, does position have role_permissions entries?
4. Is that function in app_functions table?
5. Check user_audit_logs for when permissions changed

**Solution:**
1. Check current permissions: `SELECT permissions FROM users WHERE id = ?`
2. Check role permissions: `SELECT * FROM role_permissions WHERE role_id = ?`
3. Add missing role_permissions: `INSERT INTO role_permissions ...`
4. Or directly set user permissions: `UPDATE users SET permissions = ... WHERE id = ?`

### Issue: Deletion is failing even with can_delete = true

**Check:**
1. Is Admin being checked? (Admins have delete disabled by default)
2. Is server-side check happening? (Client check might pass, server fails)
3. Is user.roleType = 'Admin'? (Falls back to roleType if permission not explicit)

**Solution:**
1. Set explicit permission: `UPDATE users SET permissions = ... WHERE id = ?`
2. Or promote to Master Admin if needed
3. Verify server-side permission check is using same logic

### Issue: Role permissions not applying to users

**Check:**
1. Does user have role_type set? (Not null)
2. Does user have position_id set? (For position-based roles)
3. Do role_permissions entries exist? (Query role_permissions table)
4. Are function_ids correct? (Foreign key to app_functions)

**Solution:**
1. Ensure user.role_type is set correctly
2. Ensure user.position_id links to correct position
3. Create role_permissions entries: `INSERT INTO role_permissions ...`
4. Test with simple function: `SELECT * FROM role_permissions WHERE role_id = ? LIMIT 5`
